## üìå Notes & Next Steps

-   Keep `.env` and secrets out of git; use CI/CD secrets or a secrets manager for staging/production.
-   Prioritize automated tests that cover security-sensitive code paths (auth, assignment, status transitions).
-   Consider adding lightweight integration tests that exercise the WebSocket manager and Telegram notifier in a mocked environment.
