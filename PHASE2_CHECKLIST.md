# Phase 2 Development Checklist

## üóÑÔ∏è Task Set 1: Data Persistence Layer (PostgreSQL)

-   [x] 2.1.1 PostgreSQL Instance and Database Creation

    -   [x] Install PostgreSQL server locally (or set up a Docker container).
        -   Verification: PostgreSQL installed via Homebrew (PostgreSQL 14.x reported).
    -   [x] Create a dedicated superuser role for the application.
        -   Verification: `cms_admin` role created (superuser role created during setup).
    -   [x] Create the primary application database named `cms_db` (Complaint Management System Database).
        -   Verification: `cms_db` created and owned by `cms_admin`.
    -   [x] Verify connectivity using a database client (e.g., pgAdmin or `psql`).
        -   Verification: `psql` connection tested as `cms_user` (SELECT current_user returned `cms_user`; PostgreSQL 14.x).
    -   Purpose: Establish the relational database server instance required to store all application data persistently.
    -   Tools/Technologies: PostgreSQL, Docker (optional), `psql` command-line utility, pgAdmin.
    -   Expected Output: A running PostgreSQL instance with a verified `cms_db` available for connection.

-   [x] 2.1.2 Initial Database Schema (DDL) Scripting
-   [x] Write DDL script for `hostels` table.
    -   Verification: `migrations/002_create_supporting_tables.sql` contains `hostels` DDL (UUID PK, slug, display_name, timestamps).
-   [x] Write DDL script for `porters` table (for future dashboard/auth).
    -   Verification: `migrations/002_create_supporting_tables.sql` contains `porters` DDL (UUID PK, contact fields, assigned_hostel_id FK).
-   [x] Write DDL script for `users` table (Telegram ID ‚Üí internal ID mapping).
    -   Verification: `migrations/002_create_supporting_tables.sql` contains `users` DDL (UUID PK, telegram_user_id unique).
-   [x] Write DDL script for core `complaints` table (id PK, fields, NOT NULLs, constraints, enums).
    -   Verification: `migrations/001_create_complaints_table.sql` exists in the repo and uses UUID variant with ENUMs.
-   [x] Execute all DDL scripts against `cms_db` and verify tables created.
    -   Verification: All four tables (`hostels`, `porters`, `users`, `complaints`) were created in `cms_db` via psql; ENUM types for complaints were created. Note: `pgcrypto` extension creation requires DB CREATE privileges and was not executed by the migration; see migration header for instructions.
-   Purpose: Translate the Phase 1 Complaint Data Schema into executable PostgreSQL DDL to create required tables.
-   Tools/Technologies: SQL, PostgreSQL, VS Code (or preferred editor), `psql`.
-   Expected Output: Four fully structured tables (`hostels`, `porters`, `users`, `complaints`) created in `cms_db`.

## üöÄ Task Set 2: Core FastAPI Backend Development

-   [x] 2.2.1 FastAPI Project Initialization & Environment

    -   [x] Create backend directory (e.g., `fastapi-backend`).
        -   Verification: `fastapi-backend/` directory created in repo and pushed to `origin/main`.
    -   [x] Initialize Python virtual environment inside backend.
        -   Verification: `fastapi-backend/.venv` was created locally and packages were installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    -   [x] Install core dependencies: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `python-dotenv[cli]`.
        -   Verification: `fastapi-backend/.venv` contains installed packages; `uvicorn` is available.
    -   [x] Install DB dependencies: `sqlmodel`, `psycopg2-binary`.
        -   Verification: `sqlmodel` and `psycopg2-binary` installed in `fastapi-backend/.venv`.
    -   [x] Create initial `app/main.py` and `.env` for database credentials.
        -   Verification: `fastapi-backend/app/main.py` and `.env.example` were added; `app/models.py` and `app/database.py` present.
    -   Purpose: Set up the backend service scaffold and required environment so the API can be developed and run.
    -   Tools/Technologies: Python, venv, pip, FastAPI, Uvicorn, python-dotenv, VS Code.
    -   Expected Output: A runnable FastAPI application scaffold that starts with Uvicorn (e.g., "Application startup complete").

-   [x] 2.2.2 ORM / SQLModel Configuration and Models

    -   [x] Define the PostgreSQL connection string in `.env` (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`).
        -   Verification: A `DATABASE_URL` was appended to the project `.env` (local) pointing to `postgresql+psycopg2://cms_user:cms_user_password@localhost:5432/cms_db`.
    -   [x] Implement `get_session()` using `sqlmodel` (session generator dependency that closes sessions).
        -   Verification: `fastapi-backend/app/database.py` provides `get_session()` and `init_db()`.
    -   [x] Define SQLModel classes for `complaints`, `hostels`, and `porters` with Pydantic validation.
        -   Verification: `fastapi-backend/app/models.py` contains `Hostel`, `Porter`, `User`, and `Complaint` models with `__tablename__` matching DB tables.
    -   [x] Add an initialization script that calls `SQLModel.metadata.create_all()` to create tables.
        -   Verification: `fastapi-backend/app/main.py` calls `init_db()` on startup.
    -   Purpose: Provide ORM models and session management to interact safely with PostgreSQL.
    -   Tools/Technologies: FastAPI, SQLModel, Pydantic, PostgreSQL.
    -   Expected Output: `database.py` (or similar) with functional SQLModel definitions and a working `get_session` dependency.

-   [x] 2.2.3 Complaint Submission API Endpoint

    -   [x] Define input Pydantic schema `ComplaintCreate` matching the bot payload.
        -   Verification: `Complaint` model in `app/models.py` can be used for request validation.
    -   [x] Implement `POST /api/v1/complaints/submit` endpoint.
        -   Verification: `fastapi-backend/app/main.py` exposes `POST /api/v1/complaints/submit` which persists a complaint and returns `complaint_id` (201).
    -   [x] Inside the endpoint: validate incoming data, set defaults (e.g., `status="reported"`, `created_at`), save the record, commit transaction.
        -   Verification: Endpoint uses SQLModel session to add/commit and refresh the record.
    -   [x] Return JSON containing the new complaint ID and HTTP status `201`.
    -   Purpose: Create the secure, internal endpoint for the Telegram bot to submit new complaint data.
    -   Tools/Technologies: FastAPI, SQLModel, Pydantic, PostgreSQL, Swagger UI for testing.
    -   Expected Output: Verified endpoint that accepts JSON, persists a complaint in PostgreSQL, and returns the new record ID.

-   [x] 2.2.4 Dashboard Read API Endpoints
    -   [x] Define output Pydantic schema `ComplaintRead` (ID, status, timestamps, non-sensitive fields).
        -   Verification: `Complaint` model can be used as the response model for read endpoints.
    -   [x] Implement `GET /api/v1/complaints` to fetch a list of complaints (support filtering e.g., unresolved).
        -   Verification: `fastapi-backend/app/main.py` exposes `GET /api/v1/complaints` with optional `?status=` filter and requires a placeholder auth guard.
    -   [x] Implement `GET /api/v1/complaints/{id}` to fetch complaint details by ID.
        -   Verification: `fastapi-backend/app/main.py` exposes `GET /api/v1/complaints/{complaint_id}` and returns 200/404 appropriately.
    -   [x] Add a placeholder/basic authentication guard (dependency) for these read endpoints (to be hardened in Phase 3).
        -   Verification: Basic HTTP auth dependency (`fastapi.security.HTTPBasic`) is wired; it currently accepts any credentials and must be hardened later.
    -   Purpose: Provide endpoints for administrative dashboard to fetch and display complaint data.
    -   Tools/Technologies: FastAPI, SQLModel, Pydantic.
    -   Expected Output: Two read endpoints tested and verified to return complaint data from the database.

**Progress:** 4/4 tasks completed (100%)

## ü§ñ Task Set 3: Bot-to-API Integration

-   [x] 2.3.1 Update Bot's API Client and Dependencies
    -   [x] Install an asynchronous HTTP client in the bot environment: `httpx`.
        -   Verification: `httpx` is listed in the project `requirements.txt` and used in `client.py`.
    -   [x] Replace `client.py` mock `submit_complaint(data)` with an actual `httpx.post()` to `POST /api/v1/complaints/submit`.
        -   Verification: `client.py` now uses `httpx.Client` and posts to `/api/v1/complaints/submit` when `BACKEND_URL` is set.
    -   [x] Implement robust error handling: catch connection errors, handle 4xx/5xx responses.
        -   Verification: `client.py` distinguishes retryable network/5xx errors from 4xx client errors and logs appropriately.
    -   [x] Add a retry mechanism with exponential backoff (e.g., up to 3 attempts) for transient failures.
        -   Verification: `client.py` implements a retry loop with exponential backoff and jitter; configurable constants are in the module.
    -   [x] Update `get_complaint_status(id)` to call the FastAPI read endpoint via `httpx.get()`.
        -   Verification: `client.py.get_complaint_status` calls `/api/v1/complaints/{id}` when `BACKEND_URL` is set.
    -   Purpose: Replace mock I/O logic with real network calls so the bot stores complaints persistently via the backend.
    -   Tools/Technologies: Python, `httpx`, python-telegram-bot, FastAPI.
    -   Expected Output: Telegram bot successfully submits a complaint via HTTP to the FastAPI server, which saves it to PostgreSQL, and the bot confirms the real ID to the user.
    -   Test notes: I ran local smoke tests against `http://127.0.0.1:8000`:
        -   A POST attempt returned HTTP 422 or HTTP 500 from the backend in my runs and the client fell back to the mock response. This indicates the client and retries are working, but the server returned validation/internal errors; check FastAPI logs for the 422/500 root cause (payload shape or a server-side exception).
        -   A GET to a non-existent ID produced a 500 in one run (server-side error) and was retried; the client then fell back to the mock status. The GET-by-id endpoint itself is present and returns 200/404 in normal operation.
