# Admin Self-Registration with OTP: Feasibility Analysis

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation: ‚ö†Ô∏è Proceed with CAUTION - Implement a Hybrid Approach**

While admin self-registration with OTP is technically feasible, allowing completely open admin registration poses significant security risks for a complaint management system. A **controlled self-registration with approval** model would balance usability with security.

---

## Current Authentication System Overview

### Current State
- **Login**: Email/phone + password via `/auth/login`
- **Admin Creation**: Programmatic only via:
  - Bootstrap: First registration creates admin (if no porters exist)
  - Admin-protected `/auth/register` endpoint
  - Seed scripts (`seed_porter.py`, `get_admin_token.py`)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with Bearer auth
- **Password Security**: pbkdf2_sha256 hashing
- **RBAC**: Two roles (`porter` and `admin`)

### Current Security Model
- Admins have elevated privileges:
  - Can view all complaints
  - Can assign any porter
  - Can set status to "closed"
  - Access to admin-only endpoints (purge, notifications, websocket stats)

## Security Analysis

### üö® Critical Security Concerns

#### 1. **Open Admin Registration = High Risk**
   - **Issue**: Anyone with an email could become an admin
   - **Impact**: Unauthorized access to sensitive complaint data, ability to manipulate assignments, delete data
   - **Mitigation Needed**: Approval workflow or invitation-only system

#### 2. **OTP Verification Alone is Insufficient**
   - **Issue**: Email ownership verification doesn't validate admin eligibility
   - **Missing**: Authorization layer (who should be an admin?)
   - **Risk**: Email hijacking, social engineering

#### 3. **No Admin Approval Mechanism**
   - Current system lacks any approval/invitation flow
   - Would need new infrastructure for admin onboarding workflow

### ‚úÖ Security Benefits

1. **Email Verification**: Confirms email ownership via OTP
2. **Password Recovery**: Reduces support burden for lost passwords
3. **Audit Trail**: Self-registration can be logged for compliance

---

## Implementation Feasibility

### Technical Complexity: **Medium-High**

#### Required Components:

1. **Email Service Integration** ‚öôÔ∏è
   - **Status**: Not currently in codebase
   - **Options**: 
     - SMTP (SendGrid, AWS SES, Mailgun)
     - Third-party APIs (Resend, Postmark)
   - **Complexity**: Medium - requires SMTP/API setup, templates

2. **OTP Management** üîê
   - **Database Schema**: New table for OTP tokens
     ```python
     class OTPToken(SQLModel, table=True):
         id: str (UUID)
         email: str (unique)
         code: str (hashed)
         purpose: str ('signup', 'password_reset')
         expires_at: datetime
         attempts: int
         used: bool
     ```
   - **Storage**: Redis (fast) or database (simpler)
   - **Complexity**: Medium - rate limiting, expiration, secure generation

3. **Password Reset Flow** üîÑ
   - **Endpoints**: 
     - `POST /auth/forgot-password` (request reset)
     - `POST /auth/reset-password` (verify OTP + set new password)
   - **Complexity**: Low-Medium

4. **Admin Approval Workflow** (RECOMMENDED) ‚ö°
   - **Options**:
     - **Invitation-based**: Existing admin sends invitation email
     - **Approval queue**: Self-registration ‚Üí pending approval ‚Üí admin approves
     - **Domain whitelist**: Only allow emails from specific domains
   - **Complexity**: Medium - requires new endpoints and admin UI

---

## Recommended Implementation Strategy

### üéØ **Hybrid Approach: Invitation-Based Admin Self-Registration**

This balances security with usability:

#### Phase 1: Secure Admin Invitation System
1. **Existing admins invite new admins**:
   - Admin sends invitation via UI/API
   - System sends invitation email with unique token
   - Token expires after 48 hours
   - Email contains link to signup page with token

2. **Invited user self-registers**:
   - User clicks invitation link
   - Token validated ‚Üí shows signup form
   - Email already filled (from token)
   - User sets password + OTP verification
   - Account created as admin automatically

#### Phase 2: Forgot Password Flow
1. User requests password reset
2. OTP sent to registered email
3. User verifies OTP ‚Üí sets new password
4. All sessions invalidated (optional security enhancement)

#### Phase 3: Enhanced Security (Optional)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Admin activity logging
- Suspicious login detection

## Implementation Outline

### 1. Database Schema Changes

```python
# New model for admin invitations
class AdminInvitation(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: str (UUID)
    email: str
    invited_by: str (FK to Porter.id)
    token: str (unique, secure random)
    expires_at: datetime
    used: bool = False
    created_at: datetime

# New model for OTP tokens
class OTPToken(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: str (UUID)
    email: str
    code_hash: str  # Hashed OTP code
    purpose: str  # 'signup', 'password_reset'
    expires_at: datetime
    attempts: int = 0
    max_attempts: int = 3
    used: bool = False
    created_at: datetime
```

### 2. New API Endpoints

```
POST   /auth/admin/invite           # Admin sends invitation
GET    /auth/signup?token={token}   # Validate invitation token
POST   /auth/signup                 # Complete registration with OTP
POST   /auth/verify-otp             # Verify OTP code
POST   /auth/forgot-password        # Request password reset
POST   /auth/reset-password         # Reset password with OTP
```

### 3. Email Service Integration

**Recommended**: Use environment variables for configuration
```python
# In .env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=apikey
SMTP_PASSWORD=<api_key>
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

**Dependencies to add**:
- `emails` or `fastapi-mail` for email handling
- Or direct SMTP via `smtplib` (simpler but less robust)

### 4. Security Considerations

1. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Max 3 OTP requests per email per hour
   - Max 5 failed OTP attempts ‚Üí lock account for 15 minutes
   - Use `slowapi` or similar for FastAPI rate limiting

2. **OTP Generation**:
   - 6-digit numeric code (or 8-digit)
   - Cryptographically secure random
   - Hash before storing (like passwords)
   - 10-minute expiration

3. **Invitation Security**:
   - Unique token per invitation (UUID + secret)
   - Expires after 48 hours
   - Single-use (marked as used after signup)

4. **Password Requirements**:
   - Minimum 8 characters
   - Require complexity (mixed case, numbers, special chars)

---

## Alternative: Domain-Based Auto-Approval

If you have a controlled email domain (e.g., all admins use `@youruniversity.edu`):

1. Allow self-registration with OTP
2. Automatically approve if email domain is whitelisted
3. Others require manual admin approval

**Pros**: Simpler implementation  
**Cons**: Less flexible, domain control required

---

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Benefits ‚úÖ
- **Reduced Support Burden**: Admins can recover passwords independently
- **Faster Onboarding**: New admins can self-register (with invitation)
- **Better UX**: Modern authentication flow
- **Scalability**: Easy to add more admins without manual scripts

### Costs & Risks ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Initial Development**: 2-3 days for full implementation
- **Infrastructure**: Email service costs (~$10-50/month for SendGrid starter)
- **Maintenance**: Monitor email deliverability, handle OTP failures
- **Security Risk**: If not properly implemented, could expose system

---

## Final Recommendation

### ‚úÖ **YES, but with modifications:**

1. **Implement Invitation-Based Self-Registration**:
   - Existing admins send invitations
   - Invited users self-register with OTP verification
   - No open registration (security-critical)

2. **Implement Forgot Password Flow**:
   - Low risk, high value
   - OTP-based password reset

3. **Phase Out Bootstrap Admin Creation**:
   - Keep for initial setup only
   - Add warning if used in production

### üö´ **Avoid Open Admin Registration**:
   - Too risky for complaint management system
   - Would allow unauthorized access to sensitive data
