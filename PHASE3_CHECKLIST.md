## üñºÔ∏è Media handling (photos & attachments)

-   [ ] 3.8 Photo uploads and storage

    -   Purpose: Allow reporters to attach images; store them securely and serve thumbnails/links to dashboard.
    -   Tools/Technologies: S3-compatible storage (MinIO/AWS S3), signed URLs, FastAPI upload endpoint
    -   Expected Output: Upload endpoint returning signed URLs; access restricted to authenticated users.

-   [ ] 3.9 Thumbnailing & size limits
    -   Purpose: Reduce bandwidth and display-friendly thumbnails; enforce size/type limits.
    -   Tools/Technologies: Pillow or libvips, background worker (Celery/RQ) optional
    -   Expected Output: Thumbnails produced and available via authenticated endpoints; upload size/type limited.

**Progress:** 0/2 tasks completed (0%)

## üõ†Ô∏è CI/CD, Infra & Production Readiness

-   [ ] 3.10 CI: GitHub Actions workflow

    -   Purpose: Run tests and lint on PRs and prevent regressions before merges.
    -   Tools/Technologies: GitHub Actions, PostgreSQL service in CI, Python matrix
    -   Expected Output: Workflow that runs unit and integration tests; PRs block on failing tests.

-   [ ] 3.11 Dockerize backend and optional worker

    -   Purpose: Standardize dev and production builds; enable local reproducible environments.
    -   Tools/Technologies: Dockerfile, docker-compose, optional Redis/Postgres services
    -   Expected Output: docker-compose up for local dev; reproducible CI builds.

-   [ ] 3.12 Observability: logging, metrics, error tracking
    -   Purpose: Make system observable and trace errors in staging/production.

## üìà Overall Progress

**Total Tasks:** 15
**Completed:** 1

## Next steps

1. Create issues for each top-level task and assign owners & estimates in your issue tracker.
2. Convert the sprint items into smaller tickets and start with authentication + CI.
3. Add migrations (Alembic) before making schema changes (e.g., adding Porter.role/password_hash).
